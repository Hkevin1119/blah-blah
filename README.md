# Combat
Welcome to the game of Combat. In Combat the main idea is to reduce your opponent's health down to zero and the way you do that is
through the cards you have in your hand and the special powers that the face cards hold. 

## Materials Needed
- A deck of 52 playing cards
- (optional) A piece of paper to track health

## Rules
The rules of the game is very simple. The main goal of the game is reduce your opponent's health down to 0.
Each player has a maximum of 30 health (Needs Testing). The game consists of rounds. Each round starts with each 
player drawing a set of 5 cards. The players then use any method they want to decide who goes first. After deciding
the turn order. You begin the round!
That player that goes first may play any card from their hand. Depending on the color of the card you will either damage the enemy player or heal yourself. 
After you have played your card for that turn, it switches to the next player. 
You continue this turn switching until both players no longer have any cards that is the end of the round. 
You then regrab 5 cards and start a new round. 
You continue to play as many rounds needed until one player's health reaches zero or goes below zero.

### Basic cards
If the card you play is Black then you deal X amount of damage to the enemy player. The damage dealt is dependent on the number of the card. 

Example  
<img src= "/images/1200px-Playing_card_spade_9.svg.png" width="120">

If you were to play a 9 of Spades, then you would deal 9 damage to the enemy player.
So if the enemy player was at 30 health they would then be at 21 health.

If the card you play is Red then you would heal X amount of damage to your health. The health healed is dependant on the number of the card.

Example  
<img src= "/images/5-of-hearts.png" width="120">

If you were to play a 5 of Hearts, then you would heal 5 health to yourself.
So if you had 25 health before using the card then you would then be at 30 health.
If you are at maximum health when using the card then the card has no effect.

### Face Cards

Face Cards have unique attributes and should be played differently from the regular number cards.

Each face card has it's own power that will change the flow of the game and introduce strategy for the players.

#### King
The King face card makes it so that the next damaging that you play will deal double damage. For example if I play a king card on one turn, I let the opponent play their card and then play a 9 of Spades, instead of dealing the usual damage of 9 you will instead deal 18 damage. If you do not deal damage before the round is over, then the next round the damage boost will no longer count. 

#### Queen
The Queen face card makes it so that the next healing card you play will heal you for twice the ammount. For example I play the queen card on Turn 1, I let my opponent play their card on turn 2. Then on Turn 3 I play a 5 of Hearts, then instead of usual healing of 5 I instead heal for 10. If you do not play a healing card before the round is over then the heal boost will no longer count. 

#### Jack/Joker
The Jack or Joker face card makes it so that each player must return all the cards they currently have in their hand and grab new cards. The amount of cards that each player grabs back must equal the amount of cards they had before the Jack was played.
